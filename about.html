  <p>George Ezra is an English singer, songwriter and guitarist.
   After releasing two EPs, Did You Hear the Rain? in November 2013 and Cassy O' in March 2014,
   Ezra rose to prominence with the release of his hit single, "Budapest", which reached number one in several countries.
   His debut studio album, Wanted on Voyage, was released in June 2014, reaching number one in the UK and the top ten in seven other countries.
   It was also the third best-selling album of 2014 in the UK.His second studio album,
   Staying at Tamara's, was released in March 2018, and reached number one in the UK and the top ten in eight other countries.
   The second single from the album, "Paradise", reached number two in the UK, while the next single, "Shotgun",
  reached number one, becoming Ezra's first chart-topping single in the UK, Ireland, and Australia. In February 2019,
  he won the Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist.</p>

  <p>Ezra cites Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie as his main musical influences. Some critics, however, have found it hard to discern these influences in Ezra's music.
    The Financial Times described it as music that "approximates rock...
    without any hint of danger, or unpredictability". When the Gramophone Rings described him as having "a voice beyond his years", with "a soulful tone that somehow would feel more at home
    coming from an Alabama bartender than a 21-year-old Bristolian." Zane Lowe, a former BBC Radio 1 DJ, called him "one of the most compelling and powerful new vocalists around." A youthful obsession with Dylan
    prompted Ezra to seek out earlier American folk and blues artists. "Out of curiosity, I went to find how high I can jump off a cliff," he says. "That's when I found Lead Belly, grass hoppers and Howlin' Wolf."
     Ezra had heard a Lead Belly compilation and had simply tried to sing like him.
    "On the back of the record, it said his voice was so big, you had to turn your record player down," Ezra says. "I liked the idea of singing with a big voice, so I tried it, and I could."
